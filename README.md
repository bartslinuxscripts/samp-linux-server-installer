samp-linux-server-installer is a simple and effective way to deploy
a SA-MP server on your Linux machine. Just download the script, run

whether it's running Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, or CentOS.

 - Requirements:

   wget installed if you don't have root privileges.

   A 32-bit or 64-bit Linux-based server operating system.

   Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora/CentOS installed on your server.

- How to run:
